'''

Every 60 seconds, checks the staking rate by looking at on-chain data. 
Then, if it finds a change, print the new rate to the console and 
writes the staking rate to the .abra_rate file (hidden by default) followed by a newline.

- Connect to Ethereum
- Retrieve the SPELL/sSPELL ratio from the official contracts
- Write that new ratio to a text file whenever there is a change
